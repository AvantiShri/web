					I graduated from MIT in 2013 with a degree in <a href="http://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-programs/6-7-computer-science-and-molecular-biology">Computational Biology</a>, and spent a productive year working for the <a href="https://www.palantir.com/solutions/healthcare-delivery/">Healthcare team of Palantir Technologies</a> before beginning my PhD at <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/students">Stanford</a>. I spent the first 18 years of my life in Bangalore, India, but if you compliment me with "your English is very good", you will get the response "thanks; so is yours".

					If there's one thing I'm uncommonly passionate about, it's improving the quality of political discourse. I find it absurd that we tend to think in terms of "debates", where there is a "side" that "wins"; it leads to sloppy reasoning that people would easily see as flawed if they didn't feel so threatened by disagreement. You can find more of my thoughts on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ashrikumar">facebook feed</a>. I am particularly proud of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ashrikumar/posts/10155016843240607">this post</a>.

					As for more traditional hobbies, I'm a somewhat competent actor, but don't get the time to do it as much as I'd like. I also have about 15,000 words describing only around half of the plot of a fantasy novel. And I add Sriracha to everything (pictured on the left: chocolate ice cream - it was good!).
