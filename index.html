	<p>
		I'm a senior PhD candidate in the  Department of Computer Science at Stanford, advised by Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/">Anshul Kundaje</a>. I develop broadly-applicable methods to make deep learning models interpretable, and have applied these methods to study regulatory genomics. In order of my excitement, my PhD projects are:

		<ul>
			<li> <a href="https://github.com/kundajelab/tfmodisco">TF-MoDISco</a>, a method that leverages input-level importance scores produced by deep learning models or SVMs to reveal recurring patterns in genomic data.
			<li> <a href="https://github.com/kundajelab/deeplift">DeepLIFT</a>, a computationally efficient method for generating input-level importance scores to explain individual predictions made by a deep learning model.
			<li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07024">Selective classification via curve optimization</a>, a method for deciding which examples a predictive model should abstain on to optimize rank-based metrics such as auPRC.
			<li> <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/07/146431">Separable fully-connected layers</a>, a novel architectural component for deep learning models that takes advantage of recurring positional patterns in genomic data. 
			<li> <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/06/457606">Gkmexplain</a>, a computationally efficient method for generating input-level importance scores to explain individual predictions made by nonlinear gapped-kmer support vector machines.
			<li> <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/27/103663">Reverse-complement parameter sharing</a>, a novel architectural component for deep learning models that takes advantage of symmetries induced by the double-stranded nature of DNA.
			<li> <a href="https://github.com/kundajelab/simdna">simDNA</a>, a package for generating simulated regulatory genomic sequences.

		 I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science with Molecular Biology from MIT and spent a year working as a developer for the <a href="https://www.palantir.com/solutions/healthcare-delivery/"> Healthcare team of Palantir Technologies</a> before starting my PhD.
