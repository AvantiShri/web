						<p> Up until sophomore year of college, I had a hobby of graphing designs on a TI-83 using parametric equations. I especially enjoyed plotting the names of girls I was trying to impress in cursive (although, in retrospect, it never seemed to correlate with romantic success). One time someone dared me to do an emperor penguin with a baby at its feet. A YouTube video of the result is linked on the left.</p>

						The summer before I came to MIT, I decided to simulate a NxNxN Sudokube (a cross between a Rubik's Cube and a Sudoku puzzle). I had never taken a formal programming course, so while the code is in python (and uses the VPython library), it uses none of Python's object oriented features and probably contains many bugs. But hey, if someone thinks they might actually use this somewhere, reach out to me and we can talk (but I'd probably have to rewrite the code from scratch, for my own dignity).
